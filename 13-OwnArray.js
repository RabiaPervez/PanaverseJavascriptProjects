// Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

const MyArray = ["Ducati HeavyBike", "Tesla x"];
console.log("I would love to own a", MyArray[1], "one day");
console.log("I would love to have my own" , MyArray[0]);
