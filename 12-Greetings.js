//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

var Friends = ["Aleena", "Maha", "Mehwish"];
for (i = 0; i < Friends.length; i++){
    console.log("Hello", Friends[i]);
}
