// Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.

//This code displays a quote by Albert Einstein
console.log(`Albert Einstein once said, “A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.”`);

//This code does the same task, but in a different manner
var famous_person = "Albert Einstein";
var mesaage = `${famous_person} once said, "A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.”`;
console.log(mesaage);
